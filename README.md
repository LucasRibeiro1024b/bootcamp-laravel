## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects. Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


# Laravel Bootcamp

## Quick Installation

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel chirper
cd chirper
php artisan serve
```

After that change on .env the DB_CONNECTION to sqlite and delete all other DB_* options.

I did the installation using laragon evironment, but you can use docker as well, just follow the bootcamp guide. ðŸ˜‰

## Installing Laravel Breeze

I chose Vue.js for this section and beyond.

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install vue
```

Be mindful that laravel/breeze manages the front-end, that said recall it everytime you went to modify the fron-end.

Now run npm Vite module to "hot-module replacement", that means your changes in the code goes direct to the page, it gonna reload as you change it.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Laravel Artisan also takes care of the Database, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

to commit the local configuration of tables to the database. (sqlite in our case)

## Creating Chirps

Chirps are short messages here.

### Models, Migrations and Controllers

This command is used to create a "Model, Migration and Controller".

```bash
artisan make:model
```

Now let's make our Chirp files.

```bash
php artisan make:model -mrc Chirp
```

By looking at the

```bash
php artisan make:model --help
```

We could see that the -mrc option means that artisan will create a migration, a model, and a resource controller named Chirp.
